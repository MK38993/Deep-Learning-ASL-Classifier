# Metis Project 6: Human Detection - PROPOSAL
 
### Question/need:
The goal of this project is to identify American Sign Language (ASL) hand signs from images. While ASL has "shorthand" for many commonly-used phrases, it is more difficult to parse these signs because most of them rely on movement, instead of a single static gesture.

### Data Description:
The data consist of 7000-8000 images of hand signs for each letter (including "backspace" and "spacebar"), and about 3000 images with no signs shown. Many of these images are of the same person, but at a slightly different angle.
	
### Tools:

Pandas and Numpy for data handling

Tensorflow's Keras module for modeling, using convolutional neural networks.

Pillow Library for image processing
